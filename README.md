<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=alia5&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="alia5" /> </p>

I'm a Software Developer by day, hacker at night (sometimes...), interested in all things technical: Programming, hacking, 3D-printing, gaming and also a photography and Photoshop nut.  

Check out my [blog](https://behind.flatspot.pictures) or some [artsy stuff](https://www.flatspot.pictures) I do.

Time is limited, don't expect high availibilty.
