### Hi, I'm Peter

I'm a Software Developer by day, hacker at night (sometimes...), interested in all things technical: Programming, hacking, 3D-printing, gaming and also a photography and Photoshop nut.  

Check out my [blog](https://behind.flatspot.pictures) or some [artsy stuff](https://www.flatspot.pictures) I do.
